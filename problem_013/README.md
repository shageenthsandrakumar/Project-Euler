## Solution 1: Complete Summation

### Approach

- Parse all 100 fifty-digit numbers from the input string.
- Convert each number to an integer and compute their sum directly.
- Extract the first 10 digits by converting to string and slicing.
- This is the most straightforward approach with no optimization.

**Reference:** The full Python implementation is available in [`solution_1.py`](solution_1.py).

### Detailed Explanation

- **Step 1: Parse Input**
  - Split the multi-line string by newlines: `numbers.splitlines()`.
  - Each line contains one 50-digit number as a string.
  
- **Step 2: Convert and Sum**
  - Use a generator expression to convert each string to an integer: `int(num) for num in numbers.splitlines()`.
  - Compute the sum using Python's built-in `sum()` function.
  - Python handles arbitrary-precision arithmetic automatically, so there's no overflow.

- **Step 3: Extract First 10 Digits**
  - Convert the sum to a string: `str(sum(...))`.
  - Slice the first 10 characters: `str(sum(...))[:10]`.
  - The result is a string containing the first 10 digits.

- **Step 4: Why This Works**
  - The sum of 100 fifty-digit numbers is at most: $100 \times 10^{50} = 10^{52}$.
  - Therefore, the sum has at most 53 digits.
  - Actually, since each number is less than $10^{50}$ (not equal), the sum is strictly less than $10^{52}$.
  - This means the sum has exactly 52 or 53 digits.
  - For the given input, the sum has 52 digits.

- **Efficiency:** This solution performs one full addition of 100 fifty-digit numbers. Python's arbitrary-precision arithmetic handles this efficiently, completing in microseconds. While this computes more than necessary (we only need 10 digits), the simplicity and clarity make it an excellent baseline solution.

## Solution 2: Complete Summation (Map Function)

### Approach

- Parse all 100 fifty-digit numbers from the input string.
- Use `map()` function to convert each number to an integer.
- Compute their sum directly using Python's arbitrary-precision arithmetic.
- Extract the first 10 digits by converting to string and slicing.
- This is functionally identical to Solution 1 but uses a more functional programming style.

**Reference:** The full Python implementation is available in [`solution_2.py`](solution_2.py).

### Detailed Explanation

- **Step 1: Parse Input**
  - Split the multi-line string by newlines: `numbers.splitlines()`.
  - Each line contains one 50-digit number as a string.
  
- **Step 2: Convert Using Map**
  - Use `map(int, numbers.splitlines())` to lazily convert each string to an integer.
  - `map()` returns an iterator, making this memory-efficient.
  - The conversion happens as the sum is computed.

- **Step 3: Compute Sum**
  - Pass the map object directly to `sum()`: `sum(map(int, numbers.splitlines()))`.
  - Python handles arbitrary-precision arithmetic automatically.
  - The sum is computed in a single pass through the data.

- **Step 4: Extract First 10 Digits**
  - Convert the sum to a string: `str(sum(...))`.
  - Slice the first 10 characters: `str(sum(...))[:10]`.
  - The result is a string containing the first 10 digits.

- **Comparison to Solution 1:**
  - **Solution 1:** Uses generator expression with explicit `for` syntax.
  - **Solution 2:** Uses `map()` function, more functional programming style.
  - Both compute the exact same result with the full 50-digit numbers.
  - Performance is essentially identical.

- **Efficiency:** Like Solution 1, this performs one full addition of 100 fifty-digit numbers. The use of `map()` provides a slight memory advantage by using lazy evaluation, though the difference is negligible for only 100 numbers.

## Solution 3: Truncation (11 digits)

### Approach

- Truncate each 50-digit number to its first 11 digits before summing.
- Sum these truncated values using a generator expression.
- Extract the first 10 digits from the result.
- This approach is based on the mathematical proof that trailing digits have minimal impact on the leading digits of the sum.

**Reference:** The full Python implementation is available in [`solution_3.py`](solution_3.py).

### Detailed Explanation

- **Step 1: Truncate Each Number**
  - For each 50-digit number, take only the first 11 digits: `num[:11]`.
  - Convert to integer: `int(num[:11])`.
  - This discards the last 39 digits of each number.

- **Step 2: Sum Truncated Values**
  - Use a generator: `int(num[:11]) for num in numbers.splitlines()`.
  - Compute the sum of these 11-digit numbers.
  - The sum will have approximately 13 digits (100 eleven-digit numbers).

- **Step 3: Extract First 10 Digits**
  - Convert sum to string and slice: `str(sum(...))[:10]`.
  - The entire operation is a single chained expression.

- **Step 4: Why This Works**
  - See the **Mathematical Foundation** section below for the rigorous proof that 11 digits is mathematically sufficient.
  - The proof shows that the maximum error from discarding the last 39 digits cannot affect the first 10 digits of the sum.

- **Efficiency:** This solution is faster than Solutions 1 and 2 because it operates on smaller numbers (11 digits instead of 50). The reduction in precision is mathematically guaranteed not to affect the first 10 digits.

## Solution 4: Regex-Based Parsing

### Approach

- Use regular expressions to extract the first 11 digits from each line.
- Handle potential edge cases like empty lines or negative numbers (though not present in this problem).
- Filter out any invalid matches before summing.
- This demonstrates a more robust parsing technique.

**Reference:** The full Python implementation is available in [`solution_4.py`](solution_4.py).

### Detailed Explanation

- **Step 1: Regex Pattern**
  - Pattern: `r"^-?\d{0,11}"`
    - `^` matches the start of the string
    - `-?` optionally matches a negative sign
    - `\d{0,11}` matches 0 to 11 digits
  - This pattern extracts up to 11 leading digits from each line.

- **Step 2: Extract Matches**
  - For each line: `re.match(r"^-?\d{0,11}", l).group(0)`
  - This returns the matched substring (first 11 digits as a string).
  - Generator expression: `(re.match(...).group(0) for l in numbers.splitlines())`

- **Step 3: Filter and Convert**
  - `filter(None, ...)` removes any empty strings (from blank lines).
  - `map(int, ...)` converts each string to an integer.
  - `sum(...)` computes the total.

- **Step 4: Extract First 10 Digits**
  - Convert to string and slice: `str(sum(...))[:10]`.

- **Why Use Regex?**
  - **Robustness:** Handles malformed input gracefully.
  - **Flexibility:** Easy to adjust the pattern for different requirements.
  - **Generality:** Works with inputs that may have extra whitespace or formatting.
  - For this specific problem, the regex approach is overkill, but it demonstrates good software engineering practices.

- **Efficiency:** Slightly slower than Solutions 2 and 3 due to regex overhead, but still very fast in absolute terms. The difference is negligible for 100 numbers.

### Rigorous Proof: Why 11 Digits Suffices

**Theorem:** For the sum of 100 fifty-digit numbers, keeping the first 11 digits of each number is sufficient to correctly determine the first 10 digits of the sum.

---

**Proof:**

Let $n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_{100}$ be 100 numbers where each satisfies $10^{49} \leq n_i < 10^{50}$ (i.e., each is a 50-digit number), and let $S = \sum_{i=1}^{100} n_i$ be their sum. 

Since each number is a 50-digit number, we have $10^{49} \leq n_i < 10^{50}$, which gives us $100 \times 10^{49} \leq S < 100 \times 10^{50}$, or equivalently $10^{51} \leq S < 10^{52}$. This means $S$ has exactly 52 digits (it cannot reach $10^{52}$ due to the strict inequality).

In a 52-digit number, the 10th digit from the left is in the $10^{52-10} = 10^{42}$ place. When we keep the first $k$ digits of each number, we can write $n_i = a_i \times 10^{50-k} + r_i$ where $a_i$ is the first $k$ digits (the kept part), $r_i$ is the remainder (the discarded part), and $0 \leq r_i < 10^{50-k}$. 

The true sum is therefore:
$S = \sum_{i=1}^{100} n_i = \sum_{i=1}^{100} (a_i \times 10^{50-k} + r_i) = 10^{50-k} \sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i + \sum_{i=1}^{100} r_i$

Let $A = \sum_{i=1}^{100} a_i$ (sum of kept parts) and $R = \sum_{i=1}^{100} r_i$ (sum of discarded parts), so $S = A \times 10^{50-k} + R$.

The maximum possible value of $R$ is $R < 100 \times 10^{50-k}$. For the error $R$ not to affect the 10th digit (which is in the $10^{42}$ place), we need $R < 10^{42}$. This requires $100 \times 10^{50-k} < 10^{42}$, which simplifies to $10^{52-k} < 10^{42}$, giving us $52 - k < 42$ and therefore $k > 10$. Hence we need $k \geq 11$ digits.

With $k = 11$ (keeping first 11 digits), the maximum error is $R < 100 \times 10^{39} = 10^{41}$, and since the 10th digit is in the $10^{42}$ place, we have $10^{41} < 10^{42}$, so any error from $R$ can only affect the 11th digit onward. Therefore, the first 10 digits are guaranteed to be correct. âˆŽ

### Why 11 Digits is Optimal

- **10 digits is insufficient:** With $k = 10$, we have $R < 10^{42}$, which is at the boundary and provides no safety margin.
- **11 digits is sufficient:** With $k = 11$, we have $R < 10^{41}$, providing a full order of magnitude of safety.
- **12+ digits provide extra margin:** While mathematically unnecessary, using 12 digits gives additional confidence but requires more computation.

This proof demonstrates that the truncation in Solutions 3 and 4 is not just a heuristic. It's mathematically rigorous.
