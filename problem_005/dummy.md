Understood. I have integrated the new solution (`solution_3.py`) into the documentation following your instructions, focusing on formal discussion, avoiding code display, and clearly breaking down the concepts, including Python **generators** and the **Incremental Sieve** method, as per your preference.

Here is the revised, comprehensive Markdown document.

# Problem 5: Smallest Multiple

**Problem source:** [Project Euler Problem 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)

**Problem statement:**

$2520$ is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from $1$ to $10$ without any remainder.

What is the **smallest positive number** that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from $1$ to $20$?

-----

## The Core Mathematical Concept: Least Common Multiple (LCM)

The problem seeks the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of all positive integers from $1$ to $20$, denoted as $\text{LCM}(1, 2, 3, \dots, 20)$.

The fundamental principle for calculating the LCM relies on the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**, which posits that every positive integer can be uniquely factored into a product of prime numbers. To construct the LCM, we must include every prime factor $p$ present in the numbers up to the threshold $N=20$, raised to its highest necessary power.

The formula for the LCM is:

$$
\text{LCM}(1, 2, \dots, N) = \prod_{p \leq N} p^k
$$Where:

* $p$ is a prime number such that $p \leq N$.
* $k$ is the **maximum integer exponent** such that $p^k \leq N$.

This maximum exponent $k$ can be efficiently determined using the logarithm of the threshold $N$ with respect to the prime $p$:

$$k = \\lfloor \\log\_p(N) \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{\\ln(N)}{\\ln(p)} \\rfloor
$$The primary distinction between the presented solutions lies in the method used to **efficiently generate the required prime numbers** up to the threshold $N=20$.

## Solution 1: Trial Division Prime Generation

### Approach

This method generates the primes up to the threshold $N$ using **trial division**, the most intuitive but computationally demanding technique.

1.  It iterates through candidate integers, testing each one for divisibility by all previously identified prime numbers.
2.  Any candidate not divisible by a smaller prime is confirmed as a new prime.
3.  Once the necessary primes are found, the maximum exponents are calculated using the logarithmic formula, and the final LCM is computed by multiplying the primes raised to these powers.

### Efficiency

Trial division is straightforward but becomes inefficient for larger thresholds, as the number of division checks grows with both the threshold and the count of discovered primes.

## Solution 2: Half-Sieve (Optimized Sieve of Eratosthenes)

### Approach

This solution employs the **Sieve of Eratosthenes**, an ancient and highly efficient algorithm for prime generation.

1.  It implements a **half-sieve optimization**, which exclusively processes and stores odd numbers. This reduces memory usage by approximately 50% and enhances speed.
2.  The sieve iteratively marks multiples of each prime (starting from its square) as composite.
3.  The remaining unmarked numbers (along with the number 2) constitute the set of primes.
4.  The final LCM is determined by applying the maximum exponent formula to these primes.

### Efficiency

The half-sieve optimization makes this method roughly **two times faster** than a full sieve and is considered the optimal approach for finding all primes up to a moderate, fixed limit.

-----

## Solution 3: Incremental Sieve with a Generator

### Approach

This method provides an elegant, memory-efficient alternative by using a **prime number generator** based on the **Incremental Sieve** (a form of Wheel Factorization Sieve).

1.  A Python **generator** is used to produce primes one at a time, **on demand**, rather than pre-calculating and storing a complete list.
2.  The generator intelligently tracks the multiples of previously found primes in a dictionary, which allows it to efficiently skip composite numbers as it iterates through candidate integers.
3.  The main program consumes primes from the generator sequentially, stopping once a prime exceeds the threshold $N=20$.
4.  For each required prime, the maximum exponent is calculated using the logarithmic formula, and the LCM is incrementally updated.

### Detailed Explanation: Python Generators

A **generator** is a specialized function in Python that acts as an **iterator**. It uses the `yield` keyword to return a sequence of values without terminating its execution. When a value is yielded, the function's internal state (local variables, execution point) is preserved. When the next value is requested, execution resumes exactly from where it was paused. This approach is highly **memory-efficient** because it computes and generates values only when needed, avoiding the need to store a large data structure of all results in memory.

### Detailed Explanation: The Incremental Sieve

The Incremental Sieve within the generator functions as a dynamically updated sieve:

  * It handles the only even prime, $2$, immediately.
  * It maintains a dictionary where the **keys** are composite numbers (the next multiples to be struck out), and the **values** represent the step size needed to find the subsequent multiple of the prime that initially marked that key.
  * When a candidate number is encountered that is **not** present in the dictionary, it is confirmed as a **prime** and is yielded. Its first multiple to be tracked (its square) is then added to the dictionary, along with the appropriate step size.
  * When a candidate number *is* found in the dictionary, it is a **composite** number. The dictionary entry is updated to track the next multiple of the corresponding prime, efficiently moving the sieve forward. This eliminates redundant checks and allows the sieve to progress seamlessly.

### Efficiency

The Incremental Sieve is highly efficient for generating primes sequentially. Its memory footprint is minimal because it relies on a small dictionary rather than a large pre-allocated array, making it particularly useful for scenarios where a continuous stream of primes is required.

## Output

The smallest positive number evenly divisible by all numbers from $1$ to $20$ is:

```
232792560
```

## Notes

  - The smallest number divisible by all integers from $1$ to $20$ is **$232{,}792{,}560$**.
  - Prime factorization: $232{,}792{,}560 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \cdot 17 \cdot 19$.
  - The problem is equivalent to finding $\text{LCM}(1, 2, 3, \dots, 20)$.
  - **Solution 2 (Half-Sieve)** is generally the fastest for finding all primes up to a moderate, fixed limit.
  - **Solution 3 (Incremental Sieve with Generator)** is an elegant, memory-efficient alternative, especially useful if you need to generate a stream of primes indefinitely or only up to a point without pre-calculating the entire array.
  - The logarithmic method for computing exponents avoids iterative division and is highly efficient for vectorized operations (Solutions 1 and 2) or single-prime calculation (Solution 3).
