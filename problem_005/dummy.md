I see you have a detailed explanation of Project Euler Problem 5 and its solutions, and you want to integrate a new solution, `solution_3.py`, into the documentation. This new solution uses a **prime generator** based on a variation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes known as the **Incremental Sieve** or **Wheel Factorization Sieve**.

As you requested, I'll break down the new solution and integrate it into a new, comprehensive Markdown file. I'll make sure to explain the `generator` concept and the workings of the Incremental Sieve clearly, fitting your preference for breaking down explanations from the beginning.

Here is the new Markdown file, incorporating the new solution and maintaining the original structure.

# Problem 5: Smallest Multiple

**Problem source:** [Project Euler Problem 5](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)

**Problem statement:**

$2520$ is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from $1$ to $10$ without any remainder.

What is the **smallest positive number** that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from $1$ to $20$?

-----

## The Core Mathematical Concept: Least Common Multiple (LCM)

The problem asks for the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** of all numbers from $1$ to $20$, denoted as $\text{LCM}(1, 2, 3, \dots, 20)$.

To find the LCM of a set of numbers, we use the **Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic**, which states that every positive integer has a unique prime factorization.

$$
\text{LCM}(1, 2, \dots, N) = \prod_{p \leq N} p^k
$$Where:

* $p$ is a prime number less than or equal to $N$ (the threshold, which is 20).
* $k$ is the **maximum exponent** such that $p^k \leq N$.

This ensures the resulting number is divisible by every integer $\leq N$, as it contains every required prime factor to the highest power possible within the range.

The exponent $k$ can be calculated using logarithms:

$$k = \\lfloor \\log\_p(N) \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\frac{\\ln(N)}{\\ln(p)} \\rfloor
$$The different solutions primarily vary in how they **efficiently generate the required prime numbers** up to $N=20$.

## Solution 1: Trial Division Prime Generation

### Approach

This approach uses **trial division**—the simplest, but least efficient, method for finding primes. It tests each candidate number $n$ for divisibility by all previously found primes. Once all primes up to $N$ are found, the LCM is computed using the logarithmic formula for exponents.

**Reference:** The full Python implementation is available in [`solution_1.py`](https://www.google.com/search?q=solution_1.py).

### Efficiency

Trial division is straightforward but inefficient for large thresholds. For $\text{nums} = 20$, it performs approximately $20$ iterations with divisibility checks against a growing list of primes.

-----

## Solution 2: Half-Sieve (Odd-Only Optimization)

### Approach

This solution uses an **optimized Sieve of Eratosthenes**—the classical, highly efficient algorithm for prime generation.

1.  It uses a **half-sieve**, which only stores and processes odd numbers, saving approximately 50% memory and speeding up the process.
2.  The sieve marks multiples of each prime as composite, leaving only the primes unmarked.
3.  Primes are extracted, and the LCM is calculated as in Solution 1.

**Reference:** The full Python implementation is available in [`solution_2.py`](https://www.google.com/search?q=solution_2.py).

### Efficiency

The half-sieve is approximately **2× faster** than the full sieve and uses **50% less memory**. This is the optimal method for generating primes up to moderate limits.

-----

## Solution 3: Incremental Sieve with a Generator

### Approach

This solution utilizes a **prime number generator** based on the **Incremental Sieve** (or **Wheel Factorization Sieve**).

1.  It uses a **Python generator** to produce primes one at a time, **on demand**.
2.  The generator uses a dictionary to keep track of the *next* time a prime's multiples will be encountered, allowing it to skip composite numbers very efficiently without pre-calculating a large sieve array.
3.  The main loop consumes primes from the generator, stops when the prime exceeds $N=20$, and computes the LCM using the logarithmic formula.

**Reference:** The full Python implementation is available in [`solution_3.py`](https://www.google.com/search?q=solution_3.py).

### Detailed Explanation

#### 1\. Understanding Python Generators

A **generator** in Python is a special type of function that returns an *iterator* (an object that can be looped over). Unlike a normal function that returns a single result and terminates, a generator uses the `yield` keyword to *pause* execution, return a value, and save its internal state (variables, loops). When the next value is requested, execution *resumes* from where it left off.

This is highly memory-efficient, as it computes and yields values only when requested, rather than building a full list of all primes in memory.

#### 2\. The Incremental Sieve (`prime_generator`)

This generator is an elegant implementation of the Sieve of Eratosthenes that works *incrementally* and only needs to consider odd numbers starting from $3$:

  * **Initialization:**
      * `yield 2`: The only even prime, $2$, is yielded immediately.
      * `D = {}`: A dictionary `D` is created to store the sieve data.
          * **Key:** A composite number $c$ (the *next* multiple to be marked).
          * **Value:** The **step size** needed to find the *next* multiple of the prime that *initially* marked $c$. This step is $2p$, where $p$ is the marking prime.
  * **The Sieve Loop (`for c in itertools.count(3, 2)`):**
      * This infinite loop iterates over all odd candidate numbers $c$: $3, 5, 7, 9, 11, \dots$ (using `itertools.count(3, 2)`).
      * **Case 1: $c$ is Prime (`if c not in D`):**
          * If the current number $c$ is *not* in the dictionary `D`, it means $c$ has not been marked as a multiple of any smaller prime, so it must be **prime**.
          * `D[c * c] = 2 * c`: The new prime $c$ is added to the sieve structure. The first multiple of $c$ we need to track is its square, $c^2$. The step size to find the next odd multiple of $c$ is $2c$.
          * `yield c`: The prime $c$ is returned to the main program.
      * **Case 2: $c$ is Composite (`else`):**
          * The number $c$ is a multiple of some smaller prime $p$.
          * `step = D.pop(c)`: We retrieve the step size ($2p$) and remove $c$ from the dictionary.
          * `next_multiple = c + step`: We calculate the next odd multiple of $p$ after $c$.
          * **Collision Handling (`while next_multiple in D`):** A small multiple $p_1$ might also be a multiple of another small prime $p_2$. This loop ensures we find the *first* multiple of $p$ that is not *already* being tracked in the dictionary as a multiple of another prime.
          * `D[next_multiple] = step`: The next, higher multiple is added to `D` with the same step size $2p$.

#### 3\. Computing the LCM

The main loop consumes the primes and calculates the final result:

```python
for p in prime_gen:
    if p > nums:
        break
    else:
        # LCM formula: answer *= p^(floor(log_p(nums)))
        answer *= p**int(math.log(nums)/math.log(p))
```

  * It stops the generator when the prime $p$ is greater than the threshold `nums` (20).
  * For each prime $p$, it uses the logarithmic formula to find the maximum required power $k$ and multiplies it into the running `answer`.

### Efficiency

The Incremental Sieve is highly efficient because it does not require pre-allocating memory for the entire range (like a traditional Sieve) and efficiently skips composite numbers by consulting the small dictionary `D`. It is an excellent choice for generating primes one by one up to a moderate limit.

## Notes

  - The smallest number divisible by all integers from $1$ to $20$ is **$232{,}792{,}560$**.
  - Prime factorization: $232{,}792{,}560 = 2^4 \cdot 3^2 \cdot 5 \cdot 7 \cdot 11 \cdot 13 \cdot 17 \cdot 19$.
  - The problem is equivalent to finding $\text{LCM}(1, 2, 3, \dots, 20)$.
  - **Solution 2 (Half-Sieve)** is generally the fastest for finding all primes up to a moderate, fixed limit.
  - **Solution 3 (Incremental Sieve with Generator)** is an elegant, memory-efficient alternative, especially useful if you need to generate a stream of primes indefinitely or only up to a point without pre-calculating the entire array.
  - The logarithmic method for computing exponents avoids iterative division and is highly efficient for vectorized operations (Solutions 1 and 2) or single-prime calculation (Solution 3).
